\item Run soapcpp2 on this file to generate the SOAP/XML processing logic. Use soapcpp2 option -\/I to specify paths for \#import To build with STL, 'stlvector.h' is imported from 'import' dir in package. Use soapcpp2 option -\/i to generate improved proxy and server classes.
\item Use wsdl2h options -\/c and -\/s to generate pure C code or C++ code without STL.
\item Use 'typemap.dat' to control namespace bindings and type mappings. It is strongly recommended to customize the names of the namespace prefixes generated by wsdl2h. To do so, modify the prefix bindings in the Namespaces section below and add the modified lines to 'typemap.dat' to rerun wsdl2h.
\item Use Doxygen (www.doxygen.org) on this file to generate documentation.
\item Use wsdl2h options -\/nname and -\/Nname to globally rename the prefix 'ns'.
\item Use wsdl2h option -\/d to enable DOM support for xsd:anyType.
\item Use wsdl2h option -\/g to auto-\/generate readers and writers for root elements.
\item Struct/class members serialized as XML attributes are annotated with a '@'.
\item Struct/class members that have a special role are annotated with a '\$'.
